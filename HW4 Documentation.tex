\section{Introduction}
This work is based on Zhu Zhuo's Master Thesis on controller designing for a Mobile Inverted Pendulum (MiP). We will first examine his controller's performance by running various tests in Simulink. Then we will try to design a controller using state-estimate feedback using parameter experimentally determined by Zhu Zhuo. Lastly we will conduct various tests on our controller and further discuss its performance
